As planet spins around his sun 
A farm embraces the autumn leaves 
a cozy dreamless sleep in winters 

Sip of a warm tea 
Old wooden smell on paper books 
Warmth of heat in cold hearts of mine 

Longed comfort of lifetimes 
Peace silence stability 
Red roses and letters 

Silence of too much louder 
Not surfing on surface adventures 
A warm touch of  love 
That’s my love 
That’s she 
Aarya
